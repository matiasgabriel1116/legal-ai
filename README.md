## ðŸ§  How It Works - Intelligence Stack

The BNR Platform adjusts its AI chat behavior based on document availability:

- If no documents are uploaded by the admin, the lawyer interacts with a general GPT-4 Turbo model.
- If the admin uploads documents, the assistant uses those to provide contextually accurate responses.
- If both admin and the lawyer upload documents, the assistant responds based on the combined document set for enhanced accuracy.

### 1. Legal Knowledge Base
- Indexed Saudi regulations, court rulings, and official circulars
- Organized using a classification system based on 32 legal categories

### 2. GPT-4 Turbo Engine
- Delivers contextual and accurate legal assistance through prompt engineering
- Provides fallback answers when no document match is found

### 3. Case Knowledge Extraction
- LlamaIndex parses user-uploaded documents (PDF, Word)
- Extracted content is used to enhance response relevance and accuracy
